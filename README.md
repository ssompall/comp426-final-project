# COMP 426 Final Project - Cooking Mama Recipe Finder!

Group Members: Raye Oji & Snigdha Sompalli

You can use this to find recipes for ingredients you have in your kitchen, or just to try new things! We named it after one of the most iconic games of our childhoods: Cooking Mama! 

Here is the video demo link: https://youtu.be/wPwh8JdV0o0 


- **Third-Party API:** We used 'Edamam Recipe Search API' to access a wide range of recipes online

## User Authetication / User-Specific Preferences

- **Authentication:** Users can create an account and login into their already existing accounts. If a user inputs the wrong password for an account that already exists, or tries to sign up with a username that already exists they will receive an Error. However we weren't able to figure out how to delete one's account before the deadline. 
- **Preferences:** Users who have logged in can favourite recipes and save them for later, and can see all of the recipes that they have favorited. They can also delete saved recipes and have them no longer be part of their favorites. 

## How to Run
1. Run ``npm install`` in the terminal.
2. Run ``npm start`` to run the site on http://localhost:3000
